# z-waif
Fully local &amp; open source AI Waifu. VTube Studio, Discord, Minecraft, custom made RAG (long term memory), alarm, and plenty more! Has a WebUI and hotkey shortcuts. All software is free (or extremely cheap)!

Requires Windows 10/11 and a CUDA (NVidia) GPU with atleast 12GB+ of video memory. 16GB is reccomended.
Uses Oobabooga, RVC, and Whisper to run all AI systems locally. Works as a front end to tie many programs together into one cohesive whole.

The goal of the project is less about giving an "all in one package", and moreso to give you the tools and knowledge for you to create your own AI Waifu!

## Changelog

V1.2

- Lorebook messages are now directly infused into the encoding as it is sent.
	- This now sends all relevant lore triggered within the past 3 message sets, instead of just 1 with a required cooldown.
	- Lore triggering requirements were improved, to add plurals and fix edgecases.
	- You can still view what lore is triggered via the UI Logs.
- Random Memories will now trigger before the alarm.
	- This allows your bot to randomly scan your chat history, and remember past times.
	- You can also trigger random memories manually via the UI.

- Your VTuber can now look around, either Following Faces or Randomly.
	- This requires setting up 6 emotes for your VTuber. In order, they should have your VTuber's eyes doing the following (they can be named anything); 
		- "Look Slight Right"
		- "Look Right"
		- "Look Very Right"
		- "Look Slight Left"
		- "Look Left"
		- "Look Very Left"
	- In the .env, change "EYES_FOLLOW" to "Random" or "Faces". Set the "EYES_START_ID" to whatever emote slot the "Look Slight Right" is set up as.
		- Make sure all the eye looking emotes follow eachother in order. You can re-order them in VTube Studio if needed.
	- Obviously, you need a camera for the VTuber to follow faces, as well as the Vision module enabled.

- Other Roleplay Suppression is now disabled if you have "Cutoff at Newlines" off.
	- This will allow the bot to send messages containing character lines, such as "User:" or "Riley:".
	- This is to allow lists, info, and multi-user RP scenarios, if you want.
- Fixed issues with the RAG history desyncing when undoing messages.
