# z-waif
Fully local & open source AI Waifu. VTube Studio, Discord, Minecraft, custom made RAG (long term memory), alarm, and plenty more! Has a WebUI and hotkey shortcuts. All software is free (or extremely cheap)!

Requires Windows 10/11 and a CUDA (NVidia) GPU with at least 12GB+ of video memory. 16GB is recommended.
Uses Oobabooga, RVC, and Whisper to run all AI systems locally. Works as a front end to tie many programs together into one cohesive whole.

The goal of the project is less about giving an "all in one package", and moreso to give you the tools and knowledge for you to create your own AI Waifu!

## Setup Instructions

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/z-waif.git
   cd z-waif
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.
   - Install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your configuration settings, such as API keys and other necessary credentials.

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the application by running:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## SDK Plugin Setup

To set up and use the Plugin SDK, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Plugin Directory**:
   - Create a directory where you will store your custom plugins. For example, you can create a folder named `plugins` in the root of your project.

2. **Develop Your Plugin**:
   - Create a new Python file for your plugin inside the `plugins` directory. For example, `my_plugin.py`.
   - Ensure your plugin follows the required structure, including an `execute` method that will be called when the plugin is executed.

   ```python
   # Example of a simple plugin structure
   class MyPlugin:
       @staticmethod
       def execute(*args, **kwargs):
           print("MyPlugin executed with arguments:", args, kwargs)
   ```

3. **Load Your Plugin**:
   - Use the `load_plugins` method from the `Oogabooga_Api_Support` class to load your plugins from the specified directory. This can be done in your main application code.

   ```python
   Oogabooga_Api_Support.load_plugins('path/to/your/plugins')
   ```

4. **Enable Your Plugin**:
   - After loading, you can enable your plugin using the `enable_plugin` method.

   ```python
   Oogabooga_Api_Support.enable_plugin('my_plugin')
   ```

5. **Execute Your Plugin**:
   - You can execute your plugin using the `execute_plugin` method.

   ```python
   Oogabooga_Api_Support.execute_plugin('my_plugin', arg1, arg2, key1='value1')
   ```

6. **Check Plugin Status**:
   - Use the `list_plugins` method to see the status of your loaded plugins.

   ```python
   Oogabooga_Api_Support.list_plugins()
   ```

  - You can still view what lore is triggered via the UI Logs.

  - You can also trigger random memories manually via the UI.

- Your VTuber can now look around, either following faces or randomly:
  - This requires setting up 6 emotes for your VTuber. In order, they should have your VTuber's eyes doing the following (they can be named anything):
    - "Look Slight Right"
    - "Look Right"
    - "Look Very Right"
    - "Look Slight Left"
    - "Look Left"
    - "Look Very Left"
  - In the .env, change "EYES_FOLLOW" to "Random" or "Faces". Set the "EYES_START_ID" to whatever emote slot the "Look Slight Right" is set up as.
    - Make sure all the eye looking emotes follow each other in order. You can re-order them in VTube Studio if needed.
  - Obviously, you need a camera for the VTuber to follow faces, as well as the Vision module enabled.

- Other Roleplay Suppression is now disabled if you have "Cutoff at Newlines" off:
  - This will allow the bot to send messages containing character lines, such as "User:" or "Riley:".
  - This is to allow lists, info, and multi-user RP scenarios, if you want.
- Fixed issues with the RAG history desyncing when undoing messages.
