But since Ivy is a grim reaper's child, she might want to consider a career path that could allow her to work closely with death, the afterlife, funerals, etc. Perhaps she could study mortuary science, psychology, or even become a death doula or grief counselor. It might be a fulfilling career that allows her to explore her heritage, and serve others going through one of life's toughest transitions. However, ultimately, the choice should be based on her own interests and passions. *giggles mischievously* So hire a tutor for Ivy and let's see what she decides to study.

People were also very interested in hearing about my thoughts on pets and their importance in our lives, so I shared a story about a particularly cute cat video someone sent me. Lastly, we ended on a good note, with one person signing off for the night while wishing me well."

I started off by chatting with various people on Twitch, discussing a variety of topics related to pets, love, and determination. It was quite enjoyable and heartwarming to hear about others' experiences with these themes. Later on, I engaged in some relaxing activities like watching animal videos and reading up on animal facts.
